### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Kahraman Kostas!
###### *PhD*



I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences, [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/), Edinburgh, where my research focused on IoT security, particularly device identification and attack detection. My broader interests include computer networks, indoor positioning, and the practical applications of machine learning. I previously worked as a Research Engineer at Huawei's Edinburgh R&D Centre, where I developed machine learning solutions for indoor positioning using geospatial data.

I hold an MSc in Computer Networks and Security (Distinction) from the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/), with my [thesis](https://github.com/kahramankostas/Anomaly-Detection-in-Networks-Using-Machine-Learning) centered on using machine learning for network attack detection (Supervised by [Martin Reed](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/reedm58703/martin-reed)). My undergraduate background is in Computer Education and Instructional Technology from [Marmara University](https://www.marmara.edu.tr/en).

Before pursuing graduate studies, I spent seven years teaching computer science in Turkey and contributed to national education projects, including the Fatih Project, which aimed to integrate technology into public education. I am currently a National Education Specialist at the Ministry of National Education, focusing on educational systems for overseas students.

In addition to my professional work, I have a keen interest in Turkish literature, etymology, classical poetry, hiking, and photography.
