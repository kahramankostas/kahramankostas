### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Kahraman Kostas!
###### *PhD Candidate*

I am a PhD student at School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences, [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/), Edinburgh Campus (Supervised by [Mike Just](https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/persons/mike-just) and [Michael Lones](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~ml355/)). My research interests are cyber security, computer networks, internet of things, indoor positioning, and machine learning. My current focus is IoT Security, especially device identification and attack detection on IoT networks. However, I am very interested in the practical use of machine learning techniques on different data types.

I worked at Huawei Edinburgh R&D centre as a Research Intern during 6 months in 2022 (Supervised by [Francisco Zampella](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=IUyobs4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Firas Alsehly](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/firas-alsehly-8169987b)). In this process, I developed various solutions to indoor positioning problems by focusing on the analysis of geospatial data with machine learning.



I graduated from [Marmara University](https://www.marmara.edu.tr/en) with a BSc in Computer Education and Instructional Technology in 2009. I took my MSc degree from [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/)  in Computer Networks and Security with Distinction in 2018. My master thesis was about detection of network attacks using machine learning methods (Supervised by [Martin Reed](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/reedm58703/martin-reed)). The [thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328512658_Anomaly_Detection_in_Networks_Using_Machine_Learning) and the [code](https://github.com/kahramankostas/Anomaly-Detection-in-Networks-Using-Machine-Learning) are available.


Between undergraduate and graduate education, I worked as a computer teacher for about seven years in a wide range of schools from elementary to high school in some provinces in Turkey (Ä°stanbul, ÅžÄ±rnak, Manisa, AdÄ±yaman). During these years, in addition to teaching, I worked as a technology consultant and conducted projects teaching programming to young people and encouraging teachers to use instructional technology. Between 2013 and 2016, I worked as a teacher trainer in the Fatih Project, a national project of the Turkish government, which seeks to integrate state-of-the-art computer technology into Turkey's public.

My personal interests include hiking, taking photos and Turkish literature, etymology and classical Turkish poetry (I obtained BA in [Turkish Language and Literature](http://abp.anadolu.edu.tr/en/program/programProfili/1677/8) with Honour in 2015. I was a PhD student in Turkish language and literature before I completely switched my route to computer science.)
